Myself Praveen Kumar Gnanavel, shortly people calls me as "pk". I graduated in Electronics and Communications Engineering in 2017 due to the interest in computer science grabbed an internship in 'MetricStream' as an Application Developer, then I got a full-time Software Engineer role in 'Larsen & Toubro Infotech'. In these 2+ years of experience, I got opportunities to explore more on DB, Java-based web development, and Linux Environment. Later, my interest falls on Data Science so I started putting my efforts into learning and exploring concepts like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing. I prefer cardio, badminton, chess, or surfing to know something in my leisure time depends on the mood and situation.
